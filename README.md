An AI app that generates and runs a neural network from a block code design.

Full feature set:
+ Vast array of over 30 different layer options for network structure
+ AI Coach that will guide a user through the process of creating their AI
+ Integration with 4 Image Processing Datasets (and room for custom data too)
